# Assignment Description 
Create a command line app to manage employees of a company. Create a database with the tables of employee, role, and department. The command line app should allow the user to add to the tables, view the tables, and update the tables. Inquirer is suppose to be used for the user input. 

# Development Process
As of the due date, I have yet to complete my query functions and my main JS file that runs the actual app. I will need to complete this at a later date due to time constraints and will ask for a regrade from a TA.
